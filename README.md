Many thanks to Udacity mentors for sharing insightul feedback on every project that I've worked on. I also thanks the students of the platform for sharing tips, making connections and giving a hand on the forums.

Regarding the section of the code, I give the respective credits to the autores inside the Python notebook with a comment on every place that I used a function for making better plots.
